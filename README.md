# Berinsky_2017

This project is a replication the paper titled "Rumors and Health Care Reform: Experiments in Political Misinformation" by Adam Berinsky. 

The article studies how political rumors shaped the health care reforms in 2010. To replicate this paper, I focus on reproducing the results generated by two experimental studies that were conducted by the Berinsky in 2010 to test the effects of different corrections on the beliefs regarding rumors concerning the 2010 Affordable Care Act.
